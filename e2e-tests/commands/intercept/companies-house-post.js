 * - Remove the delay of calling the API and waiting for a response.
 * Steps:
 * 1) Invoke cy.intercept() for the "post companies house number route"
 * 2) Depending on the company number, return a redirect to a route, as per the user journey.
 * @param {String} Company number - defaults to VALID_COMPANIES_HOUSE_NUMBER
