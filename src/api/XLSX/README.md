# XLSX Directory :file_folder:

This directory serves as a temporary storage location for generated XLSX files. These XLSX files are typically created and used during the application submission process.

Here's how this directory is used:

1. **Temporary Storage:** When an application is submitted, the system generates an XLSX file containing relevant data or reports. These files are temporarily stored here.

2. **Email Notification:** The XLSX files are typically sent as attachments in email notifications to the underwriting team or relevant stakeholders for review or further processing.

3. **Immediate Deletion:** Once the email notification with the XLSX attachment is successfully sent, the corresponding XLSX file is promptly deleted from this directory. This deletion helps maintain data security and prevent unnecessary storage consumption.

This directory acts as a transient storage point for these files, ensuring that they are available for email attachments while being promptly removed to maintain data privacy and efficient use of storage resources. :email:
