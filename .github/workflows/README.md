# Bash
A bash script is a text file that contains a series of commands that are executed by the Bash shell. Bash scripts can be used to automate tasks.
Bash scripts can be a powerful tool for automating tasks.

## Deployment 🚀

Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the code:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

This is the shebang line that specifies the interpreter to use (in this case, Bash) when executing the script.

```bash
RED='\033[1;31m'
GREEN='\033[1;32m'
BLUE='\033[1;34m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
NC='\033[0m'
```

These are variables that store escape codes for different colors. These escape codes are used to colorize the output later in the script.

```bash
printf "📝 Deployment strategy:\n"
printf "=======================\n\n"
printf "${YELLOW}0. Infrastructure 🔧${NC}\n"
printf "${RED}1. Development 🚀${NC}\n"
printf "${RED}2. Production 🚀${NC}\n"
printf "${RED}3. ACR Purge 🗑️${NC}\n\n"

read selection
```

These lines display a header and a list of deployment options with emojis and colors using `printf`. The `read` command prompts the user to enter their selection and stores it in the `selection` variable.

```bash
if [ -n "$selection" ]; then
```

This `if` statement checks if the `selection` variable is not empty.

```bash
    if [ "$selection" = "0" ]
    then
    destination=infrastructure
    branch=main
    ...
```

These `if` statements check the value of `selection` and set the `destination` and `branch` variables accordingly for each deployment option.

```bash
    if [ -n "$destination" -a -n "$branch" ]
    then
    ...
    fi
```

This `if` statement checks if both `destination` and `branch` are not empty (i.e., a valid deployment option was selected). If so, it displays the latest commit message for the selected branch, creates a new branch with the `destination` name, pushes it to the remote repository, and then deletes the temporary branch.

```bash
    else
    printf "${RED} ❌ Invalid input, terminating.${NC}\n\n";
    exit 0;
    fi
```

If the user entered an invalid selection (i.e., `destination` and `branch` are empty), this code block displays an error message and terminates the script.

# Git Hub Actions
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) platform that runs in GitHub repositories. GitHub Actions lets you automate your workflows by creating custom jobs that run on different events, such as pushes to a branch or releases.

## Source Code Analysis 🚨

This workflow will run a source code analysis (SCA) on your code whenever a pull request is submitted. The SCA will use the Codacy and Fossa tools to check for any potential security vulnerabilities and licensing issues in your code. If any vulnerabilities or issues are found, the workflow will fail and a notification will be sent to the `#exip-github-actions` Slack channel.

**Environment variables:**

* `environment`: The name of the environment to run the workflow in.
* `timezone`: The timezone to use for the workflow.

**Steps:**

1. **Setup test infrastructure**

    * 🔨 Set the environment and timezone variables.
    * 💾 Clone the repository.

2. **Codacy**

    * 🔍️ Run the Codacy SCA on the code.
    * 🚨 Report any potential security vulnerabilities to the console.

3. **Fossa**

    * ⚖️ Run the Fossa SCA on the code.
    * 📝 Report any potential licensing issues to the console.

**Tips:**

* 🧹 Use SCA tools that are appropriate for the language you are using.
* ⚙️ Configure the SCA tools to report all potential vulnerabilities and issues.
* 🔨 Fix any vulnerabilities or issues that the SCA tools report.
* 🔌 Add the SCA tools to your pre-commit hook so that they are run before you commit your code.

By using SCA tools, you can help to ensure that your code is secure and compliant with all applicable licenses.

## Lint 🎨

This workflow will run a linting check on your code whenever a pull request is submitted to the `main-application` branch. The linting check will use the `eslint` linter to check for any errors or warnings in your code. If any errors or warnings are found, the workflow will fail and a notification will be sent to the `#exip-github-actions` Slack channel.

**Environment variables:**

* `environment` : The name of the environment to run the workflow in.
* `timezone` : The timezone to use for the workflow.

**Steps:**

1. **Setup test infrastructure**

    * 🔨 Set the environment and timezone variables.
    * 💾 Clone the repository.

2. **Lint**

    * 🎨 Run the linting check on the code.
    * 🚨 Report any errors or warnings to the console.

3. **Notification**

    * 🔔 Send a notification to the `#exip-github-actions` Slack channel if the linting check fails.
    * 📝 The notification includes the status of the workflow, the steps that were run, and the errors or warnings that were found.

**Tips:**

* 🧹 Use a linter that is appropriate for the language you are using.
* ⚙️ Configure the linter to report all errors and warnings.
* 🔨 Fix any errors or warnings that the linter reports.
* 🔌 Add the linter to your pre-commit hook so that it is run before you commit your code.

By using linters, you can help to ensure that your code is clean, consistent, and easy to read.
