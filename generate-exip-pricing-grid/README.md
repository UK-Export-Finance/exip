# ðŸ“Š Generate EXIP pricing grid

This script reads the pricing grid from a XLSX spreadsheet and
transforms it to a JSON file.

## How to generate

- Step 1: âœ… Spreadsheet Preparation

  - Ensure that the sheets are in the correct order:
    - "Single Policy - Digital" should be the 1st sheet.
    - "Revolving Policy - Digital" should be the 2nd sheet.
  - Remove all introductory text from both the sheets.
  - Copy all table cells, starting from the body and paste into the
    first row, first cell of the spreadsheet.
  - Copy the first cell (risk category) and paste this into each
    appropriate column, so each section has the risk category as the
    first cell.
    - For example, "Standard Risk (S)" should be "Standard Risk" and
      present on every single row of this section.
  - The spreadsheet should now look like below:
  - Ensure only the below risk categories exists in the final
    spreadsheet.

### Expected spreadsheet format

Note that all examples do not use real data. In production, the
premium rates are different and there are many more months of cover
for each risk category.

| Risk category  | Months | 70% cover | 75% cover | 80% cover | 85% cover | 90% cover | 95% cover |
| -------------- | ------ | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Standard Risk  | 2      | 0.5%      | 0.6%      | 0.7%      | 0.8%      | 0.9%      | 0.10%     |
| Standard Risk  | 3      | 0.6%      | 0.7%      | 0.8%      | 0.9%      | 0.10%     | 0.11%     |
| Standard Risk  | 4      | 0.7%      | 0.8%      | 0.9%      | 0.10%     | 0.11%     | 0.12%     |
| High Risk      | 2      | 1.1%      | 1.2%      | 1.3%      | 1.4%      | 1.5%      | 1.6%      |
| High Risk      | 3      | 1.2%      | 1.3%      | 1.4%      | 1.5%      | 1.6%      | 1.7%      |
| High Risk      | 4      | 1.3%      | 1.4%      | 1.5%      | 1.6%      | 1.7%      | 1.8%      |
| Very High Risk | 2      | 2.1%      | 2.2%      | 2.3%      | 2.4%      | 2.5%      | 2.6%      |
| Very High Risk | 3      | 3.2%      | 3.3%      | 3.4%      | 3.5%      | 3.6%      | 3.7%      |
| Very High Risk | 4      | 4.3%      | 4.4%      | 4.5%      | 4.6%      | 4.7%      | 4.8%      |

Example with table headings (to explain what the columns are).

:warning: The table headings should not be there. The result should be
a pure table body.

| Risk category  | Months | 70% cover | 75% cover | 80% cover | 85% cover | 90% cover | 95% cover |
| -------------- | ------ | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Standard Risk  | 2      | 0.5%      | 0.6%      | 0.7%      | 0.8%      | 0.9%      | 0.10%     |
| Standard Risk  | 3      | 0.6%      | 0.7%      | 0.8%      | 0.9%      | 0.10%     | 0.11%     |
| Standard Risk  | 4      | 0.7%      | 0.8%      | 0.9%      | 0.10%     | 0.11%     | 0.12%     |
| High Risk      | 2      | 1.1%      | 1.2%      | 1.3%      | 1.4%      | 1.5%      | 1.6%      |
| High Risk      | 3      | 1.2%      | 1.3%      | 1.4%      | 1.5%      | 1.6%      | 1.7%      |
| High Risk      | 4      | 1.3%      | 1.4%      | 1.5%      | 1.6%      | 1.7%      | 1.8%      |
| Very High Risk | 2      | 2.1%      | 2.2%      | 2.3%      | 2.4%      | 2.5%      | 2.6%      |
| Very High Risk | 3      | 3.2%      | 3.3%      | 3.4%      | 3.5%      | 3.6%      | 3.7%      |
| Very High Risk | 4      | 4.3%      | 4.4%      | 4.5%      | 4.6%      | 4.7%      | 4.8%      |

- Step 2: ðŸ“¦ Pre-requites

Install all the dependencies before executing the script.

```bash
npm install
```

- Step 3: ðŸ“¦ Execute

Execute the script by passing the spreadsheet location and output
directory as an arguments.

```bash
node index.js --spreadsheet=./path/to/spreadsheet.xlsx \
  --outputDirectory=./path/to/save
```

Post execution, a JSON file will be generated in the output directory,
called `pricing-grid.json`.

## JSON result

This is just an example with a very small amount of months.

```json

  "SINGLE_POLICY": {
    "STANDARD": [

      {
        "months": 2,
        "rates": [
          {
            "insuredFor": 70,
            "premiumRate": 1.1
          },
          {
            "insuredFor": 75,
            "premiumRate": 1.2
          },
          {
            "insuredFor": 80,
            "premiumRate": 1.3
          },
          {

          {
            "insuredFor": 90,
            "premiumRate": 1.5
          },
          {
            "insuredFor": 95,
            "premiumRate": 1.6
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "VERY_HIGH": [
      {
        "months": 2,

          {
            "insuredFor": 70,

          },
          {

            "premiumRate": 2.2

          {
            "insuredFor": 80,

          },
          {
            "insuredFor": 85,
            "premiumRate": 2.4
          },
          {
            "insuredFor": 90,
            "premiumRate": 2.5

          {
            "insuredFor": 95,
            "premiumRate": 2.6
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "MULTIPLE_POLICY": {
    "STANDARD": [],
    "HIGH": [],
    "VERY_HIGH": []
  }
}
```

- Step 4: ðŸš€ Replace

To update the pricing grid, simply copy the newly generated pricing
grid JSON into the UI:
[src/ui/server/generate-quote/pricing-grid.json](https://github.com/UK-Export-Finance/exip/tree/main-application/src/ui/server/generate-quote/pricing-grid.json)

The UI will then automatically consume this JSON.

- Step 6: ðŸ§ª E2E

Cypress E2E will also needs to be amended [quote E2E tests](https://github.com/UK-Export-Finance/exip/tree/main-application/e2e-tests/cypress/e2e/journeys/quote/your-quote),
since the assertions have static price which now has been updated.
